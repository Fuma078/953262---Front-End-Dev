    <h3>Profile</h3>
    <body>
      <p>I'm a software engineering student at CAMT, Chiang Mai University, with diverse interests spanning science, technology, astronomy, and history.<br>
        I'm fascinated by how the universe works and enjoy learning about historical events that shaped our world. Beyond academics, I'm passionate about maintaining a balanced lifestyle.<br>
        I love Calisthenics workouts, which help me stay fit and disciplined. In my leisure time, I enjoy playing video games, watching movies, and listening to music – these activities help me relax and unwind after studying.<br>
        Gaming especially allows me to connect with friends and explore creative virtual worlds. I also value spending quality time with my family and friends, as these relationships are incredibly important to me.<br>
        After graduation, my goal is to join a reputable tech company where I can continuously develop my skills and advance my career. I'm committed to grinding and improving myself professionally, but I also seek a career that offers work-life balance.<br>
        Having a job that gives me time to spend with loved ones is essential to my happiness. I believe that success isn't just about career achievements, but also about maintaining meaningful relationships and personal well-being.
